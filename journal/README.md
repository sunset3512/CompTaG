Accomplishments since last update:

  adding a Solutions directory where they are needed.
* Bring up lingering concerns with LP004 in the next meeting. Such as
  re-touching on the linking issues (there is one remaining), and figuring out how
  we want to address the "Assessment" information. 
* Want to start working on other LP's to bring them all to a similar place.

CompTaG tasks:

* Figure out how can aid the processes going on in the wect and bubbles groups.
  (maybe I can help with the writing processes more since I seem to be lacking a
bit of background work going into this)
* Continue the book-club book and try to make connections to the other work we
  are currently doing in the research groups.
