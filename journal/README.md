 CompTaG Research Journal for Kyla Andersen

## (08/20/2024)

Accomplishments since last update:
* Much of LP010 is completed, such as the content featured within it and the
  accompanying workshets. Further editing will be made.
* Met with Jack and discussed his code made in the #bubbles group. 
* Created my own branch in the bubbles repo and began changing the code so it
  would work with the new dinosaur data instead of the exsisting bubble data.

Storytelling tasks:
* Change the picture featured as the cover and add a picture displaying LP010's 
  specific code from the Alice world.
* Address any final formatting errors and concerns.
* Switch over old standards for the new ones.
* Address Think/Pair/Share concerns, this might be an issue in other LP's but I
  will confirm.

CompTaG tasks:
* Meet with Jack and address some more questions that I have about the code.
* Creating a database with all of the dinosaur data will be the next step and
  ensuring the code can handle it. (So far three different test cases were
  performed successfully which contained the three different file formats 
  provided, .obj, .stl, and .glb). 
* After correctly setting up my database containing the dinosaur bones aligned
  through SVD, I will need to meet to discuss how "noise" should be added. That
  is something I am not very familiar with though I will start researching it in
  the meantime.

## (07/14/2024)

Accomplishments since last update:
* Working through some more Linear Algebra videos (I will share that link)
* Continued editing LP004, and talked with Jo regarding future tasks.
* Familiarized myself with the work being done in the wect and bubbles groups.

Storytelling tasks:

* Meet with Braeden to discuss changing directory names and worksheet names and
  adding a Solutions directory where they are needed.
* Bring up lingering concerns with LP004 in the next meeting. Such as
  re-touching on the linking issues (there is one remaining), and figuring out how
  we want to address the "Assessment" information. 
* Want to start working on other LP's to bring them all to a similar place.

CompTaG tasks:

* Figure out how can aid the processes going on in the wect and bubbles groups.
  (maybe I can help with the writing processes more since I seem to be lacking a
bit of background work going into this)
* Continue the book-club book and try to make connections to the other work we
  are currently doing in the research groups.

## (06/22/2024)

Accomplishments since last update:

* Fixed Glossary items in the Storytelling repo
* Addressed formatting and spelling items in LP004 to make it 
  flow smoother

Storytelling tasks:

* Familiarize myself with the websites and what content is going
  where
* Continue editing and revising the LP's, starting with the 
  most complete ones
* Ask about the TODO comments that request outside information
  I believe this occurs in LP007, but will confirm

CompTaG tasks:

* Met with Jack to discuss how I would begin randomly rotating
  a bubble and then finding the original position
* Started learning more about Linear Algebra (will try and take 
  that class this coming semester)

* Prepped notes for leading Book Club and worked with Jack to focus on the main
  ideas that I will be presenting

Storytelling tasks:

* Continue working on the Storytelling Project.
* Bring up concerns for the Storytelling project

CompTaG tasks: 

* Start diving into the research I learn about in the meetings and figure out
  the code that is being used there
